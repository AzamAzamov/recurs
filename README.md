Recursion && Clouser
### Recursion
Recursion in programming is like a
function that keeps calling itself. When a
function does this, its called a
recursively defined function.

But there is a rule it has to follow: it must
have a way to stop calling itslef,

or it will go on forever. This stopping rule
is called the base case

A recursive function function must have a condition to stop calling itself. Otherwise function is
called indefinetelly.

Once the condition is met, the function stops calling itself. This called the base condition

### 1.First, you need a base condition num === 0.

You also need the recursive call
findFactorial(num - 1) to ensure the number
keeps reducing at each call when you pass a
new parameter of n-1.

Then you multiply the result with the previous
number num * findFactorial(num - 1) until the
base condition is met.

#### Closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its
surrounding state (the lexical enviroment). In other words a closure gives you access to an
outer functions scope from an inner function

#### A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and
can access them. In some languages, this is not possible, or
the function must be written in a special way to create a
closure.
